# Kubernetes Labs on Amazon EKS

Welcome to the Kubernetes Labs on Amazon EKS repository! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for beginners to learn and implement various Kubernetes concepts on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of Kubernetes, starting from setting up a cluster to deploying applications with autoscaling, monitoring, and CI/CD integration.

## Benefits for Beginners

1. **Structured Learning Path**: The labs are organized in a progressive manner, starting from basic to more advanced topics. This structured approach helps beginners understand the foundational concepts before moving on to complex scenarios.

2. **Hands-On Experience**: Each lab includes practical exercises that allow learners to apply the concepts they've learned. This hands-on approach helps solidify understanding and gain real-world experience in managing Kubernetes on Amazon EKS.

3. **Real-World Scenarios**: The labs are designed around realistic use cases, providing learners with insights into how Kubernetes can be used in actual production environments.

4. **Integration with AWS Services**: By using Amazon EKS, learners will also gain familiarity with other AWS services such as Amazon RDS and ECR which are commonly used in conjunction with Kubernetes.

5. **Preparation for Professional Roles**: Completing these labs equips beginners with the skills needed for roles such as DevOps engineers, cloud engineers, and Kubernetes administrators.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster on Amazon EKS
Learn how to create and configure an Amazon EKS cluster, which will serve as the foundation for deploying applications in subsequent labs.

### Lab 2: Deploying a Simple "Hello World" Application on Amazon EKS
Deploy your first application on Amazon EKS. This lab helps you understand the basics of application deployment and management in Kubernetes.

### Lab 3: Integrating Persistent Storage with EKS Using Dynamic Provisioning
Explore how to attach persistent storage to your applications using Kubernetes dynamic volume provisioning and AWS storage services.

### Lab 4: Deploying a Simple E-commerce Application on Amazon EKS
Step up from a simple application to deploying a multi-tier e-commerce application, which will teach you about managing more complex application architectures.

### Lab 5: Integrating Amazon RDS with E-commerce Application on Amazon EKS
Learn how to integrate Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) with your application running on EKS for managed, scalable database services.

### Lab 6: Autoscaling and Monitoring for an Application on Amazon EKS
Implement autoscaling for your applications and set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to ensure your applications are running efficiently and reliably.

### Lab 7: CI/CD Pipeline Integration with GitHub Actions for an Application on Amazon EKS
Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process for your applications on Amazon EKS. This lab teaches you about modern deployment practices and automation.
